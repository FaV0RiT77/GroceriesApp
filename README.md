# GroceriesApp
A first grocery app that tries to take away less information from you, as possible. Just tap the products you need, check the aprroximate pricing and see closest shops to your location. Simple and easy. No more writing long shopping lists

Added a Room DB w/ ViemModel and use of coroutines. Kinda got lost in the process so i need to figure out how to properly put this im my project
